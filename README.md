<h3> 3. Data Cleaning and Wrangling </h3>
Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

<h3> 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h3>
Conduct EDA to answer key questions:
<li> Which countries are in the Top 20 with the Most Top-Ranked Universities?</li>
<li> What are the Top 20 Most Top-Ranked Universities in the world?</li>
<li> Compare South Asian countries with their Top Ranked Universities count.</li>

<h3> 5. Factors Affecting Ranks </h3>
Analyze the factors affecting university rankings by looking at the five dimensions used for ranking comparison.

<h3> 6. Distribution of Scores </h3>
Examine the distribution of scores across various categories to understand the performance of universities.

<h3> 7. Radar Chart </h3>
Create a radar chart to visualize the performance of a particular school across different categories.

<h3> 8. Data Analysis </h3>
<li> Pie Chart: Visualize the relative weights of different categories contributing to the rankings. </li>
<li> Heatmap: Use a heatmap to visualize the correlations between different ranking factors. </li>
